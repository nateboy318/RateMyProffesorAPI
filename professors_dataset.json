He lectures out of the book and writes maybe 5 words on the board all of class so you have to be listening to what he says. Also the exams are pretty hard and does not even cover what he lectures. Also can be pretty rude.",

Class isn't mandatory, but tests are straight from the lectures with a few questions from the book. Course is 3 exams, 2 papers, and extra credit opportunities. Exams are easy if you study! 10/10 recommend!",

Maybe its worth it to get the grade but the class is excruciating bc she is so quiet and coughs all the time (smokes like a chimney).  She can also be quite disrespectful to students. She is very old, talks very slowly, and has thick accent. Sadly I doubt i learned anything",

The essays are decent, only 1000 words.",
